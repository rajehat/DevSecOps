Feature: Checkfor cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability using arachini against gruyere

Given "arachini" is installed

When I launch an "arachini" attack with:
"""
arachini --checks=XSS --scope-page-limit=2 http://172.17.0.2:8008/login
"""

Then the output should contain "0 issues were detected"
